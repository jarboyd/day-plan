# day plan (#1)

This project kicks off my bi-weekly challenge, where I take on a new endeavor every fourteen days. Being the first, it comes with a learning curve and plenty of room for improvement. I decided to start with a tool to manage the challenge itself, focusing on staying organized and consistent.

## Project Goal

The main goal here is to build an application for setting daily goals, tracking progress, and managing tasks. While not a groundbreaking idea, it promises to be an enjoyable project to work on.

For the initial phase, I aim to implement the following features:

- Creating To-Dos
- Viewing existing tasks
- Editing capabilities, such as marking tasks as complete.

## Project Scope

Given the tight two-week timeline, the focus is on creating a functional prototype. Advanced features like authentication, push notifications, or reminders will be considered for future projects or later stages of this one.

## Running the Project

To run the project, first install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

And start the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
